# Tasks that are implemented

1) Define an interface Observer that defines the methods that an observer should implement, such as update method to receive updates from the subject.

2) Define an interface Subject that defines methods for adding, removing, and notifying observers, such as registerObserver, removeObserver, and notifyObservers.

3) Create a concrete class WeatherData that implements the Subject interface and keeps track of the list of observers. This class will be the subject that is being observed.

4) Create concrete classes that implement the Observer interface and represent the objects that will receive updates from the subject. For example, CurrentConditionsDisplay and StatisticsDisplay.

5) In the WeatherData class, implement the methods for adding and removing observers, as well as for notifying observers when the weather data changes.

6) In the observer classes, implement the update method to receive updates from the subject and display the updated weather data.

7) Finally, create a client class that creates the WeatherData object and the observer objects, and registers the observer objects with the subject.
